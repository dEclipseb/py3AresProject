Ares' Initial Proposal

"Lizard-Spock RPS"

A program and design command-line game in python allow players to compete against each other in a game of rock, paper, and scissor, with this, our program will be modified into rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. This modified game's features include a single player vs the computer, two-players, score tracking, and a user input validation which is only limited to rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and Spock. Moreover, ASCII art will be implemented to create an additional feature in the game. The game will also follow the basic rules of rock-paper-scissor, but with the addition of lizard and Spock as two new options. Overall, this will create an aesthetically pleasing and interactive user interface through the use of Python programming language and ASCII art.
